Andrea is a research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading. Her research focuses on understanding various aspects of historical and future climate variability and change. She is particularly interested in understanding how different forcing agents such as greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols interact with internal variability, to shape the climate we experience across the globe.
