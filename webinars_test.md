Andrea is a research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading. Her research focuses on understanding various aspects of historical and future climate variability and change. She is particularly interested in understanding how different forcing agents such as greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols interact with internal variability, to shape the climate we experience across the globe.

## EGU special

For the next webinars taking place in May, we have a special format: for each webinar (duration 1 hour), we invite 3 speakers who also present in the SMILE session at EGU to talk about their work.

Registration: https://forms.gle/vG9nC7sKps5z9joUA

## Monday May 10, 5pm (CEST), 11am (EDT), 9am (MDT): EGU special part 1

Alexandra Jahn: Forced Changes in the Arctic Freshwater Budget Emerge in the Early 21st Century 

Karin van der Wiel: Physical storylines of future European drought events like 2018 based on ensemble climate modelling

Nicole Ritzhaupt: Robustness of projections of European precipitation for seasonal means and seasonal extremes

## Monday May 17, 5pm (CEST), 11am (EDT), 9am (MDT): EGU special part 2

Timo Kelder: Seasonal predictions as a high-resolution large ensemble to study extreme events over recent decades

Gabrielle Dallaire / Richard Arsenault: Calibration of a reinforcement learning method with the ClimEx large ensemble and a weather generator for water management

Christopher Callahan: El Ni√±o variability mediates 21st century growth effects of climate change

In June, we will resume with the standard format: one webinar per month with an invited speaker.

We are pleased to announce Dr. Laura Suarez-Gutierrez as our next speaker in the webinar series. Laura Suarez-Gutierrez works as a postdoctoral researcher at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M). Her research focuses on understanding the internal variability of European heat extremes on different timescales. Furthermore, she works on new and better ways of evaluating the forced trends and variability in climate models using SMILEs.

_Dr. John Fyfe. Senior Research Scientist at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, Victoria BC Canada_

We are pleased to announce Dr. John Fyfe as our next speaker in the webinar series. John is one of the scientists behind the Canadian large ensemble experiments. CCCma has not only produced a large ensemble with their CMIP5 model, but was the first modelling center that uploaded large ensemble simulations for a variety of CMIP6 experiments to ESGF.
