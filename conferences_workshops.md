## Upcoming workshops

### WCRP workshop on attribution of multi-annual to decadal changes in the climate system

Registration and abstract submission are now open for the Explaining and Predicting Earth System Change Lighthouse Activity Workshop on 'Attribution of multi-annual to decadal changes in the climate system.' The workshop will take place online, from 22-24 September 2021. The aim of this workshop is to document current research, identify challenges, and explore potential pathways towards building an operational capability to attribute multi-annual to decadal changes in the climate system on global-to-regional scales.

We are particularly interested in Large Ensemble research, as this is a key tool for attribution of climate change in the face of internal variability.
 
To learn more about the workshop and to and register and/or submit an abstract, visit the workshop website at: [https://wcrp-epesc.sciencesconf.org](https://wcrp-epesc.sciencesconf.org)

The deadline for abstract submission is 30 June 2021.

### WCRP Workshop on Extremes in Climate Prediction Ensembles (ExCPEns) and associated Early Career Scientist Training and Discussion Forum

The WCRP Workshop on Extremes in Climate Prediction Ensembles (ExCPEns) and associated Early Career Scientist Training and Discussion Forum will be held online 25-27 and 27-28 October 2021 respectively.

The ExCPEns workshop will highlight the latest global research on applying subseasonal, seasonal, decadal and longer-term climate prediction ensembles to predict and assess the probabilities and nature of extreme weather and climate events.

The ECS training and networking session is targeted toward capacity development in the Asia-Pacific region, although applications from other regions will be considered.

Although the workshop is oriented primarily toward observationally initialized ensembles for subseasonal, seasonal and decadal prediction, it is aiming also to represent and explore commonalities with climate simulation and projection large ensembles as they relate to weather and climate extremes.
 
To learn more about the workshop and to register, visit the workshop website at: [https://www.wcrp-climate.org/news/wcrp-news/1702-excpens-workshop](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/news/wcrp-news/1702-excpens-workshop)

The deadline for abstract submission is 30 June 2021.
