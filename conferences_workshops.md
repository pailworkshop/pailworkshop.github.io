## Upcoming workshops

### WCRP workshop on attribution of multi-annual to decadal changes in the climate system

Registration and abstract submission are now open for the Explaining and Predicting Earth System Change Lighthouse Activity Workshop on 'Attribution of multi-annual to decadal changes in the climate system.' The workshop will take place online, from 22-24 September 2021. The aim of this workshop is to document current research, identify challenges, and explore potential pathways towards building an operational capability to attribute multi-annual to decadal changes in the climate system on global-to-regional scales.

We are particularly interested in Large Ensemble research, as this is a key tool for attribution of climate change in the face of internal variability.
 
To learn more about the workshop and to and register and/or submit an abstract, visit the workshop website at: [https://wcrp-epesc.sciencesconf.org](https://wcrp-epesc.sciencesconf.org)

The deadline for abstract submission is 30 June 2021.
